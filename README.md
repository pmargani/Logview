# prdTest Python Script Project

This is a simple Python script project. It provides a starting point for Python scripting.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point script (Hello World example)
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies (empty by default)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Copilot custom instructions and requirements

Feel free to add more scripts and requirements as your project grows.
